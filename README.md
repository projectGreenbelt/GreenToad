# projectGreenbelt

> The all in one app for status updates and current breakdowns of all public access points on the Austin Greebbelt!

## Motivation

> As local Austinites and nature lovers we felt that there needed to be a comprehensive app that fellow Greenbelters could use to be informed in  advance what are the current situations going down at each public access point. Stats to include would be water levels, weather, parking, as well as brief descriptions of each location and instructions for access.
