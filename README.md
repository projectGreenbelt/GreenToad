## Project Greenbelt (GreenToad) 

> The all-in-one app for status updates and current breakdowns of all the public access points on the Austin Greenbelt!

## Motivation

> As local Austinites and nature lovers we felt that there needed to be a comprehensive app that fellow Greenbelters could use to be informed in real-time what current situations are going down at each public access point. Stats we've currently included would are water levels, water flows, current Greenblt weather, parking, as well as brief descriptions of each location and instructions for access. 

### Learning Objectives

* Mark: Increase React proficiency by building react components as part of the View in our site. 
* James: Increase React proficiency, as well as buid skill set pertaining to user authentication and real-time interaction between application users.

### Primary Purpose Of App

1. Shows users the list of greenbelt locations in Austin, along with Austin weather information.
2. Allows them to select a location from the list of greenbelt locations.
3. Once a greenbelt location is selected, the following functionality will be available:

* View threads/posts from other users who have selected this location. 
* View directions on how to get to the selected Greenbelt location.
* Allow user to start their own thread, which can in turn be viewed by other users.
