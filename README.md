# projectGreenbelt

> The all in one app for status updates and current breakdowns of all public access points on the Austin Greebbelt!

## Motivation

> As local Austinites and nature lovers we felt that there needed to be a comprehensive app that fellow Greenbelters could use to be informed in real-time and in advance what the current situations going down at each public access point are. Stats to include would be water levels, weather, parking, as well as brief descriptions of each location and instructions for access. 

### Learning Objectives

* Mark: Increase React proficiency by building react components as part of the View in our site.
* James: Increase React proficiency, as well as better understand coding skill set pertaining to user authentication and real-time interaction between application users.

### MVP

1. Show users the list of greenbelt locations in Austin, along with Austin weather information.
2. Allow them to select a location from the list of greenbelt locations.
3. Once a greenbelt location is selected, the following functionality will be available:
a. View threads/posts from other users who have selected this location. 
b. View directions on how to get to the selected Greenbelt location.
c. Allow user to start their own thread, which can in turn be viewed by other users.
